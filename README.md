# Personal Portfolio version 1.0

![my portfolio website before revamp](/minified/img/previewV1.png)

These are all the files for my personal website, which I am in the process of revamping!  In the meantime, stop by my [blog](https://jonathansexton.me/blog) to see what I'm up to!

## Getting Started

You'll need to fork or download the repo and change the information/images around as these pertain to me only :D

### Prerequisites

None

## Deployment

If you wish to use this site you'll need to change out some of the images and information.  However, I am fine with that as long as you give credit.  

Simply fork the repo or download it to your local machine.  Open `index.html` and begin making your changes for deployment.  Once you're finished, check out [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for some ***free*** hosting
